# A full page wireframe

## The Mission

A client needs a new website for her services. The designer you are collaborating with sent you a wireframe\*. Your task is to turn this wireframe into an interactive HTML page so that the client can get a good idea if she likes the current structure or not.

Make sure that on tablet and on mobile the layout still works (for example, columns stack on top of each other, etc).

\* A **wireframe** is a schematic representation of the layout and structure of the page. It usually looks all grey. It is used to get approval on the structure, before proceeding with the real design.

## Instructions

1. Choose a framework. For this exercise it's better to start with a _component-first_ framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, rather than a _utility-first_ framework such as Tailwind.
2. Using _exclusively_ the classes provided by your framework, try to get as close as possible to the layout provided. Don't write any custom CSS.
3. Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages)

_Please note: the look and feel of the page will obviously be different. It will match the standard style of the framework of your choice. That's OK!_

## Description

Eventually I added a few of own css code for background image, fonts and colors.
I mostly made this with Bootstrap, and it took 1 day. (Fixed small things later.)
Yet following wireframe and coding wasn't really my first time, it was still difficult sometimes. But I'm proud of myself that I achieved my goal in 1 day this time, because it was much quicker than the time when I started Becode web developer course.

## Project status
It might be better to make some images align middle for smartphone layout, but I'll keep it current layout for now, since I think it is not a big problem.
